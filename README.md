# Helloüëã, welcome to my resume!

> Personal

I am a 26 year old guy with passion for coding. I live in V√§xj√∂ Sweden with my partner and daughter. I started coding
when I was 12. I started out modding minecraft and other game servers and fell in love with it. I have kept grinding
ever since never lost the spark. Coding is my primary hobby alongside gaming and Ice Hockey.
